/* Random access memory = RAM how much stuff can a computer run at once
Currently running programs are in the RAM
RAM is broken into bytes and a byte is 8 bits

Primitive data types are ints, bytes, short, long are all whole numbers 
that are positive or negative
byte = holds small numbers     
short = lil bigger than a byte, but not as big a range as int
int = the smallest/biggest int some where in the billions
long = stores reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally big numbers
float
double

The different ranges help manage the amount of memory used

A bit is 0 or 1, off or on. one bit is a single piece of memory
The more bits you have the more you can represent
1 bit = 2 items or states
2 bits = 4 items or states
3 bits = 8
4 bits =16


one byte = 8 bits 

Objects are strings and scanners, very powerful

int a = 8; this is reserving a lot of space, while byte a = 8; wouldn't be using as much
memory

floats and doubles have decimal points


The boolean Data type has only two values, true or false 
ex: "Is this password correct?" T or F?

char is a single character represented between quotes
'a'
'a' is different than "a", "a" is an object, and is much more powerful
'a' is a character, and is primitive
char are actually int, they can be added together and what not

java takes int a = 8 and puts it into an address where the 8 is broken down
to binary and stored at its memory address

a section of two or four bytes is called a word

1 nibble - 4 bits

the data type is how the computer will interrupt the 0s and 1s


Back to scanner
   int a = keyboard.nextInt();
   double b = keyboard.nextDouble();
   
   there is a next method for almost every data type
   
   
   
Can you convert a string into a char?

   char myChar;
   Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
   System.out.println("Enter your name!: ");
   String input - keyboard.next();
   myChar =input.charAt(0);
   System.out.println("You enterted: " + myChar);
   
   
   There is no next.char() you have to improvise
