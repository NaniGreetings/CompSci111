 //Be careful of integer division!!
 //if you divide an int by an int, your answer is always an int, because you are using long division, make one of the values a double.

// the - can be used for subtraction or used for a negative, they are called overloaded operators
// the + can be used for addition, but it can also be used for connecting strings "hello" + "world" = "hello world"
// "2" + "2" = "22" remember if it's in "" it's a symbol, it's not a quanity.
